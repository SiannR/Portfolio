                <li><a href="https://github.com/SiannR/Assesment-Quiz" target="_blank">Python Quiz for MAGS</a>
                    <br><p>One of my key projects is a Python-coded quiz designed for Year 11 students at Mount Albert Grammar School (MAGS). 
                    This quiz focuses on science and math topics, providing students with an interactive way to test their knowledge. 
                    The quiz features multiple-choice questions and instant feedback to help reinforce learning in these subjects. 
                    <br>My goal with this project was to create a user-friendly and educational tool that supports students in their studies while making learning more engaging. 
                    This project allowed me to apply my coding skills to solve real-world problems, and I'm proud of how it has helped students prepare for their exams.</p></li>

        <!--Design of my blog website and this portfolio-->
        <div class="blog">
            <p>Another project I worked on is a cooking blog designed specifically for teenagers interested in learning how to cook. 
                I created both the wireframe and mockup for the blog, focusing on a layout that is simple and easy to navigate for beginners. 
                The design features clear instructions, vibrant visuals, and interactive elements to make the learning process fun and accessible. 
                This project allowed me to apply my design skills to create a user-friendly platform tailored to a younger audience. 
                I used these skills I learnt to help me design the website you're on right now!</p>

                    <p>A fun Python project I created is a digital version of the classic Hangman game. 
                    As you guess letters, the game visually updates the hangman picture, adding an interactive element to the experience. 
                    This project was a great way to explore coding for entertainment, and I really enjoyed building it. 
                    It allowed me to blend logic with creativity while enhancing my programming skills in a playful way.</p></li>
