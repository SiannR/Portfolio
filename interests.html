                <li>Painting<p>In addition to my digital projects, I also have a passion for art. 
                    In my painting class, I explore different techniques and styles, allowing me to express my creativity in a hands-on way. 
                    I enjoy working with color and form, and painting gives me the freedom to bring my ideas to life. 
                    It is a great balance to my technical work, and I find that my creativity in art often inspires my approach to coding and design.</p></li>

                <li>Brain Bee<p>I participated in the Year 11 Brain Bee competition, where I gained valuable knowledge about the brain and neuroscience. 
                    I advanced through round one and had the chance to visit Auckland University. 
                    There, I met scientists and learned more about the fascinating work they do on the brain. 
                    It was an incredible, once-in-a-lifetime experience that deepened my interest in neuroscience.</p></li>
